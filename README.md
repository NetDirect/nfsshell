nfsshell
========

NFS shell that provides user level access to an NFS server, over UDP or TCP,
supports source routing and "secure" (privileged port) mounts. It's a
useful tool to manually check (or show) security problems after a security
scanner has detected them.

Originally released by Leendert van Doorn, updated to support NFSv3 by Michael Brown
